# Miner v0 Claim Extraction Fields

`miner.v0` uses a staged section-context extraction flow, but writes a simpler review schema. In the default `section-local` mode it first extracts raw candidate spans, then classifies those spans as claim, evidence, background/assumption, method/result, mixed, or abstain. Compound candidates are split into decomposed units before final claim/evidence normalization. A final atomicity repair stage checks linked claims and splits any remaining compound claims.

The alternate `abstract-full-paper` mode extracts contribution claims made in the abstract, keeps those abstract claims as the claim universe, analyzes evidence candidates from non-abstract full-paper sections, then links each claim to relevant evidence items. Abstract claims are retained even when no supporting evidence candidate is found, so missing support remains auditable.

The final review output contains paper-owned claim text, evidence item text, links, and source provenance. Profiles, SPO triples, rich context, details, and ontology mappings are not surfaced as v0 review data.

## Input Fields

| --- | --- |
| `--artifact-json` | Path to an `artifact.json` containing paper metadata, sections, spans, and parsed text. |
