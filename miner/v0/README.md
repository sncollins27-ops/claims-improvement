# Miner v0

`miner.v0` is the legacy direct model miner path. New miner work should target
`miner.agent_v1`, which is the canonical skill-capable ARA miner. Keep v0
available for compatibility with existing validator/import tooling and for
explicit `--claims.pipeline v0` runs.

`miner.v0` is the section-context miner shape simplified for the Claims subnet v0. It keeps the existing ingest, section planning, section summaries, exports, and upload-compatible files, but the extraction target is now flat claim-evidence pairs:

- paper-owned `claim_text`
- one or more evidence items per claim
- source span/section provenance

SPO fields, ontology mappings, rich context, and details are compatibility fields only. They should usually be empty.

The default mode is still section-local extraction. A second mode, `abstract-full-paper`, extracts contribution claims made in the abstract first, analyzes evidence candidates from non-abstract full-paper sections, then links those abstract claims to relevant evidence items.

## What Lives Here

- `runner.py`: end-to-end mining flow
- `__main__.py`: CLI entrypoint
- `config.py`: package-local runtime config
- `dspy_runtime.py`: DSPy/OpenRouter setup for section planning and extraction
- `grobid_client.py` and `tei_parser.py`: ingest helpers
- `prompts/`: prompt files used by the pipeline
- `CLAIM_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM.md`: staged extraction architecture and runtime contract
- `CLAIM_EXTRACTION_FIELDS.md`: v0 output field reference

## Install

From the `Claims/` directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up env vars from `.env.example`. The miner needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
PDF ingestion uses `pdf-inspector` by default. For TEI extraction with GROBID,
set `GROBID_URL` and pass `--pdf-extraction-method grobid`.

## Run

Mine directly from a PDF with `pdf-inspector`:

```bash
python -m miner.v0 --pdf /path/to/paper.pdf
```

Mine from a downloadable PDF URL:

```bash
python -m miner.v0 --pdf-url https://example.org/paper.pdf
```

Compare another PDF reader:

```bash
python -m miner.v0 --pdf /path/to/paper.pdf --pdf-extraction-method pypdf
python -m miner.v0 --pdf /path/to/paper.pdf --pdf-extraction-method grobid
```

Mine from an existing TEI XML file:

```bash
python -m miner.v0 --tei-xml /path/to/paper.tei.xml
```

Mine from a prebuilt artifact JSON:

```bash
python -m miner.v0 --artifact-json /path/to/artifact.json
```

Extract claims from the abstract and link evidence from the full paper:

```bash
python -m miner.v0 --pdf /path/to/paper.pdf --mode abstract-full-paper
```

For TEI or artifact inputs, the paper must expose an abstract. GROBID TEI abstracts are parsed into a synthetic `Abstract` section with `section_type=ABSTRACT`; artifact inputs can provide spans with `section_type=ABSTRACT` directly.

Override the output directory:

```bash
python -m miner.v0 --pdf /path/to/paper.pdf --output-dir /tmp/claims-miner-v0
```

## Outputs

Each run writes a paper folder containing:

- `artifact.json`
- `section_context_v1_output.json`
- `extracted_claims.csv`
- `manifest.json`

When GROBID is used, the run also saves `tei.xml`.

In `abstract-full-paper` mode, `section_context_v1_output.json` also includes:

- `pipeline_mode: "abstract-full-paper"`
- `abstract_claim_extraction`: abstract section and raw abstract-claim model output
- `abstract_evidence_linking`: full-paper evidence candidates, selected candidates, analyzed evidence candidates, evidence-analysis output, and raw linker output

In this mode the claim universe is contribution-only: background facts, prior-work statements, motivations, and field context are excluded unless the abstract presents them as this paper's own finding, estimate, method contribution, interpretation, or conclusion. Evidence candidates are analyzed before linking so each linked evidence item can expose the source-side `new_information` it contributes; restatement-only candidates are flagged and should not be linked as support.
